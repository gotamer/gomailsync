# Accept only the folders that matches all the Regexp Patterns.
# The path separator to use is the one provided by the store or configured (for Maildir)  
# If regexppatterns is empty all folders are accepted. Default: empty
# The format is:
# /regexp/   : Matches if regexp matches
# !/regexp/  : Matches if regexp doesn't match

# How to handle message deletion. Possible values are: expunge, trash, none
# expunge: really delete message on destination folder (with imap this will be made with a Deleted flag and a folder expunge, with maildir is a direct file remove).
# flag: mark the message with the Deleted (T) flag on destination folder. On next synchronization run the messages will be downloaded again to the folder which triggered the deletion. Note: this option will disable expunge on IMAP Stores (or the messages will be removed)
# trash: Move message to the trash folder (not yes implemented)
# none: do not do any message deletion

# Interval between folder syncs. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
