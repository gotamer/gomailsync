== Sync ==

*) option to not sync if syncstatus is missing but both folders have messages (and related force option)

*) Get passwords from external commands

*) Do not load whole mail messages in memory

== Imap ==

*) Implement QRESYNC (probably some changes are needed in go-imap to handle uint64 for HIGHESTMODSEQ)
*) Fast sync without QRESYNC (only changed messages)
*) IMAP idle for some folders
*) Option to handle all folders (like now) or only subscribed folders
*) Namespaces???

*) Client certificate authentication
*) Option to Specify ca file (now uses default golang system/distribution dependent root CA file. See for example: http://golang.org/src/pkg/crypto/x509/root_unix.go )

== Maildir ==

*) Add an option to Maildir to choose where to put new messages (new or cur). new shouldn't contains messages with flags but mutt does this.
*) Escape unsupported filesystem chars in Mailfolder (if ever needed)


== Misc ==

*) Option to log to file
*) Colored logs

*) Cleanup Tests
*) Write more Tests (Imap tests etc...)
*) Search optimizations
*) Memory optimizations
